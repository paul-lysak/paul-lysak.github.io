      <title>Markdown in Blogger</title>

      <description>For a long time I was upset with lack of native support of Markdown in Blogger. Both manual editing of HTML and lame WYSIWYG editor are counter-productive. Recently I finally had time to search for solution - and here is almost a silver bullet: StackEdit. It can be used on-line or installed as a Chrome Plugin. This is the first post written with StackEdit.
For me it worked like this - hope that by the time you read it StackEdit will be further improved and it will be a bit simpler:</description>

      <title>Sbt repository authentication</title>
      <link>http://www.aimplicits.com/posts/2014-12-16-sbt-repository-authentication/</link>

      <description>Here is brief instruction how to access repositories protected by basic authentication from sbt - checked with version 0.13. That&#39;s how one would configure custom repository in .sbt file: resolvers ++= Seq(
..
&#34;MyRepositoryName&#34; at &#34;http://repository.host.com/nexus/content/repositories/releases&#34;,
...
)
 If repository requires authentication - sbt would just show rather meaningless warning and claim that artifact isn&#39;t found: [warn] ==== MyRepositoryName: tried
[warn] http://repository.host.com/nexus/content/repositories/releases/... here goes path to artifact ...
 You&#39;ll need to know authentication realm returned by repository server in order to configure credentials.</description>

      <title>H2 LIMIT and OFFSET</title>

      <description>Funny thing - H2 in PostgreSQL compatibility mode requires that OFFSET should go strictly after LIMIT (like LIMIT 25 OFFSET 50). Otherwise it can&#39;t parse the query: error in SQL statement &#34;SELECT .......... OFFSET 0 LIMIT[*] 25 &#34;; expected &#34;[, ::, *, /, %, +, -, ||, ~, !~, NOT, LIKE, REGEXP, IS, IN, BETWEEN, AND, OR, ROW, ROWS&#34;

      <title>Scala protected methods aren&#39;t that much protected</title>

      <description>Just discovered weird behavior of Scala&#39;s protected methods: they&#39;re actually compiled to public methods in byte-code. Therefore if you try to override them in Java code with another protected method compilation will fail with something like this: &#34;attempting to assign weaker access privileges; was public&#34;. After some googling I&#39;ve discovered that other people also spotted this issue. I think such weird compiler behavior was needed because of access level mismatch in Scala and Java - but I thought that Scala&#39;s protected is more restrictive then Java&#39;s.</description>

      <description>Turned out that error &#34;org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: Multiple ResultSets were returned by the query&#34; may be caused by semicolon (;) in the end of the query when working with Postgres via JDBC </description>
